# UI 
1. The menu branches could use some work. Not all branches follow the same pattern, for example one requires you to be in one of its pages before it drops down while the others drop down regardless of what page you are on. Some of the branch pages are also under construction or not working, these should be removed from user accessibility.
2. The EOMF website implements an adaptable view UI design. While this does not change the language of data and reports, it does change the language for website navigation. Also, I am unsure of what they're called, but the little facebook bubbles that take you to the EOMF Facebook page are funny.
3. The Water Map tool implements the Fill in the Blank UI Design Pattern since it asks for the user for an address. The input field does not have a drop down to assist users or offer a list of matching locations. The accounts page also implements the simple Fill in The Blank UI Design Pattern. These input fields offer no drop downs or predictive suggestions.
